## notebooks
In this folder are examples of configuration files and workflows to process chromatin fiber tracing data with `looptrace`.
These come from the original version of the project, though, and should be considered out of date.
They are retained for the time being to still provide hints/clues if something goes awry, and to provide perhaps additional information about why something's currently the way it is, a sort of software design provenance.
